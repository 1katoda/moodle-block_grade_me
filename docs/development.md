# Development

This guide details how to work with the NPM build process to compile the SCSS.

## NPM Process

- SCSS to CSS compiling
- Autoprefixing

## Setup Local Dev Environment

1. You will need Node.js/NPM installed on your computer. You can check if you already have Node.js installed by running `node -v`, if you see a version number, itâ€™s installed. If not, follow installation instructions for your OS here: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Navigate to the plugin root directory in the command line and install the plugin dependencies: `npm install`. You may need to run `sudo npm install` depending on OS permissions.

## Working with SCSS

You should now be able to run the build task from inside the plugin's root directory. When the SCSS is compiled, NPM will create a *styles.css* file in the plugin root directory and add any necessary vendor prefixes. This file should then be automatically loaded by the plugin. Do not edit this file directly. All style changes must be done in the SCSS directory.

- To compile the SCSS for production: `npm run build`
